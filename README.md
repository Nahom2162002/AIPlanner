Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-daily-planner.git
cd ai-daily-planner

Configure your OpenAI API key:

Create a appsettings.json or Secrets.json file and add:

{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
  }
}

Run the project:

In Visual Studio, choose the target platform (Android, Windows, etc.) and hit Run.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Users input tasks with optional tags: priority, deadline, duration.

The app sends this data to the OpenAI API for intelligent scheduling.

The AI responds with a sorted, time-blocked day plan.

Users can adjust the schedule manually and receive suggestions in real-time.
